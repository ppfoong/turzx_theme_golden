# Turing 5" Smart Screen (图灵智显, Turzx) 
# - 'Golden' theme
 
 Turzx is an IPS panel display smart screen with various screen size selections that you can purchase online.

 Turzx is connected to Windows computer (desktop or laptop) using type-C USB cable. The same USB cable also powers it.
 
By running a portable software supplied together with the smart screen, your computer can pass its real-time vital data such as the following to be displayed on the smart screen:
- CPU loads, temperature, clock, power (wattage) consumption, voltage consumption, fan speed
- GPU loads, temperature, clock, power (wattage) consumption, voltage consumption, fan speed, VRAM usage
- RAM amount and utilization
- Physical HDD/SSD storage utlization and temperature
- Network uploads and downloads speed
- Sound output volume (0-100)
- Current date and time
- Current weather of your location

A theme defines how those vital data is displayed on the smart screen. Multiple themes are supported, and you can select one active theme at a time.

The same software includes a theme designer for us to design and/or make changes to the themes.

This "Golden" theme is designed by me in May 2024 for Turzx 5" smart screen.
